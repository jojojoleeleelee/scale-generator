An application built with React to generate any key of your choice.

Major, minor and even the obscure scales like locrian, dorian, mixolydian, etc.

***

### How to use:

Pick your key center. For example, if you want to print a key that starts with C, then pick 'C'

Then pick the type of scale you'd like  - your choices include, major, minor, locrian, dorian, etc.

Last but not least, hit `generate!` and you'll sees the results rendered on your page!

Enjoy!!
